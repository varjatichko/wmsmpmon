Installation of wmSMPmon is very simple:

If you would like to use autotools to build from scratch, start with next commands:
$ aclocal
$ autoheader
$ autoconf
$ automake --add-missing
and than follow steps below.

If you want to just compile the app:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Thats all.

PS: it may appear that you need to run the application under optirun wrapper:
$ optirun wmsmpmon -draw-mem -nvidia
