This software is reworked version of old wmSMPmon performance monitoring dock (NEXTStep/WindowMaker) applications. It's still based on original wmsmpcode code but added support of to 8 CPUs.

Main changes compare to previous public (3.2) version:
 - Per CPU core load bars
 - Handling of no swap configurations
 - Colorized swap label based on swap usage
 - Memory usage graph (while "-draw-mem" option specified) 
 - Option to monitor NVidia GPU (RAM usage and GPU utilization) instead of swap
Enjoy!
